# Thesis

All code used in the MSc Finance and Accounting reserach project is held in this repository. 

If results are to be replicated, the data will be needed and the working directory will have to be changed at the start of each file. For access to data, please request from chrisbate1@gmail.com

Code is written in Matlab, R and Python. Python files are in notebook format for practicality. Rstudio is recommended to follow R analysis line by line.
